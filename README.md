### Overview
This repository contains a collection of projects and code samples designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the PIC18F46K20 microcontroller. The projects vary in complexity, ranging from simple LED blinkers to more complex sensor-based systems. This repository is intended for hobbyists, students, and professionals interested in microcontroller-based projects.

### Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you'll need the following:

* Development Environment: MPLAB X IDE from Microchip for coding and compiling.
* Compiler: XC8 for the PIC18F46K20.
* Programmer/Debugger: Optional for real hardware projects (e.g., PICkit 3 or PICkit 4).
* Proteus Simulation Software: For simulating microcontroller-based projects.
* Basic Electronic Components: For real hardware projects (e.g., LEDs, resistors, buttons, sensors, etc.).
* Basic Knowledge: Understanding of C programming and basic electronics.

Setting Up MPLAB X IDE
Install MPLAB X IDE from the Microchip website.
Install the XC8 compiler.
If working with real hardware, set up your PICkit programmer/debugger.
Setting Up Proteus
Install Proteus from the Labcenter Electronics website.
Load a project or create a new one.
Import the necessary microcontroller (PIC18F46K20) and other components.
Set up your circuit design in Proteus.
Compile and simulate your code to test your project.
